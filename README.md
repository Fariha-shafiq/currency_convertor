#  Currency Converter – Real-Time Exchange Rates

A sleek, **fully responsive** currency converter web app that delivers **real-time exchange rates** using free public APIs.  
Perfect for quick conversions, currency research, or embedding into finance-related websites.

##  Why This Project Stands Out
- **Dynamic Currency List** – Automatically fetches & lists 160+ world currencies.
- **Real-Time Conversion** – Fetches the latest rates with a single click.
- **Modern UI** – Built with **Bootstrap 5** for a clean and responsive design.
- **Fast & Lightweight** – No heavy libraries, just HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS.
- **Error Handling** – Clear feedback when inputs are missing or APIs fail.
- **Global Coverage** – Supports major & minor currencies worldwide.
